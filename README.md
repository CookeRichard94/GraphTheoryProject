Graph Theory Project
The Purpose of this Project is to create a Python script that can build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression and use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given string of text

This repository was developed as part of the Graph Theory Module of 3rd Year Software Development in GMIT.

To download the repository enter to the command line and cd into an apporpriate file, then run the command 'git clone https://github.com/CookeRichard94/GraphyTheoryProject'. From there cd into the the downloaded folder. To run the script run the code 'python project.py'.
